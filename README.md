## My process

- Analyze the reference/brainstorm 
- Start with markup with HTML5
- Create all styles with CSS
- Touch up/delete any unnecessary codes

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Google APIs](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit) - For fonts

### What I learned

As I am a newbie to frontend design, I normally use default fonts when practicing frontend design skills. So it was helpful having to learn to import fonts. 

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit'>
```

### Continued development

Using flexbox is still an area that I'm not fully confident in. I understand its basic usage but I lack the skill in being able to use it efficiently.

Even though this is a simple project, I know that in future projects it will become more necessary to build my flexbox knowledge. So, I'll use these challenges as a template to help build that.
